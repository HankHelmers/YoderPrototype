            <h2>Comparing students' perceived difficulty level of CSSE220 assignments in terms of syntax and conceptual
                challenge. </h2>

            <p>You are being invited to participate in a study. This study aims to find out the students'
                perceived difficulty level of four different CSSE220 assignments in terms of syntax and conceptual
                challenge using a graphic surveying tool. This document will help you decide if you want to participate
                in this study by providing information about why and what you are asked to do. In the survey,
                you will be prompted to rank the level of difficulty of the assignments twice: first for the syntactical
                difficulty and second for the conceptual difficulty. You will be adding points to the graph with
                difficulty ranking one to five, labeled respectively, when prompted.
            </p>

            <p>Some reasons you might want to participate in this study are that it will improve the professor's
                understanding of the current status of student learning of perceived syntactic and conceptual difficulty
                at the beginning of CSSE220 and, by extension, the course for future CSSE220 students. One reason you
                might not want to participate in this study is a lack of desire.</p>

            <p>This study asks you to input points into the data surveying tool. The surveying tool will have a graph
                with the homework assignments on the x-axis and levels of perceived difficulty from one to five on the
                y-axis, five being the most difficult and one being the least. In the survey, first, you will be
                prompted to rank the syntax difficulty for an assignment with a point. You later will be prompted to
                rank the level of conceptual difficulty for that assignment with another point on the graph.
                Additionally, you will be asked to provide an estimate of the time you will spend on each of the
                assignments. You have been asked to participate in this study because you are taking CSSE220 this
                quarter.</p>

            <p>The choice to participate or not is yours; participation is entirely voluntary. You can decline to put
                points on the graph or withdraw at any time. If you wish to withdraw during the survey, you can choose
                not to respond to any potential surveys, and if you have any questions related to the survey, you can
                ask the primary investigators at any time.
            </p>

            <p>Every effort will be made to protect your anonymity by not collecting your identifying personal
                information. The points that you input to the graph cannot be tracked to a specific user due to the
                design of the surveying tool. Hence, your anonymity is ensured.
            </p>

            <p>There are some potential risks to this study. These include individual data being revealed to people
                other than the investigators, leading to a sense of retribution if individual student data is revealed to
                the professor. To remove this risk, the survey does not collect any identifying personal information.
                Also, the collected data will be shared with the professor only after the final grades for the class are
                published so that the overall data does not influence the professorâ€™s grading. It is unlikely that you
                will benefit directly by participating in this study, but the study results may benefit future
                CSSE220 students by providing feedback on instruction.
